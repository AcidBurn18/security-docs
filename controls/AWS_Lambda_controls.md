# Security Controls: AWS Lambda

| ID | Name | Description | Plane | Mapping |
|----|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| AWS-LAM-01 | Organizational Naming Standards | Enforce a strict naming convention for Lambda functions using regex patterns in AWS Config rules to ensure consistency across environments (e.g., 'project-env-function-purpose'). | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8 |
| AWS-LAM-02 | Resource Tagging Strategy | Implement mandatory tagging for all Lambda functions including CostCenter, DataClassification, and Owner. Enforce via Service Control Policies (SCPs) or AWS Config. | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8(2) |
| AWS-LAM-03 | Security Monitoring and Alerting | Enable CloudTrail Data Events for Lambda functions to log Invoke API calls. Configure CloudWatch Alarms for metric filters regarding function errors, throttles, and concurrent execution limits. | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 3.1; NIST Rev 5 AU-6 |
| AWS-LAM-04 | Least Privilege Execution Role | Assign a unique IAM Execution Role to each Lambda function. Policies must not use wildcards (*) for actions or resources. Avoid using the default 'basic execution' role if it lacks necessary granularity. | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 1.16; NIST Rev 5 AC-6 |
| AWS-LAM-05 | Environment Variable Encryption | Encrypt Lambda environment variables at rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK) with strict Key Policies. Do not use default AWS managed keys for production sensitive data. | Data Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 2.8; NIST Rev 5 SC-28 |
| AWS-LAM-06 | VPC Access Configuration | Configure Lambda functions to access resources within a VPC only when necessary. Associate strict Security Groups that allow only required outbound traffic (egress) and deny all inbound traffic (ingress is managed by the Lambda service). | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 5.1; NIST Rev 5 SC-7 |
| AWS-LAM-07 | Code Signing Enforcement | Enable Code Signing for AWS Lambda to ensure that only trusted code from approved developers (signed via AWS Signer) can be deployed to the function. | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 1.2; NIST Rev 5 SI-7 |
| AWS-LAM-08 | Prohibit Public Access | Ensure Lambda function resource-based policies do not allow public access or cross-account access to unverified principals. Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to detect external access. | Control Plane | CIS AWS v3.0 1.20; NIST Rev 5 AC-3 |
