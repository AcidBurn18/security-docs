# Security Controls: Azure AKS

| ID | Name | Description | Plane | Mapping |
|----|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| AZURE-AKS-01 | Organizational Naming Standards | Enforce standard naming conventions for the AKS cluster, node pools, and associated resource groups via Azure Policy to ensure consistency and discoverability. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8 |
| AZURE-AKS-02 | Resource Tagging Strategy | Apply mandatory tags (e.g., CostCenter, Owner, Environment, DataSensitivity) to the AKS cluster and associated resources for governance, billing, and access management. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8 |
| AZURE-AKS-03 | Security Monitoring and Alerting | Configure Azure Monitor and integrate with Azure Sentinel to ingest control plane audit logs and data plane metrics. Configure alerts for suspicious activities like privileged container creation. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 5.1; NIST Rev 5 AU-6 |
| AZURE-AKS-04 | Managed Identity for Cluster Resources | Utilize System-assigned or User-assigned Managed Identities for the AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources (ACR, Key Vault, Load Balancers) instead of legacy Service Principals. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 2.1; NIST Rev 5 AC-3 |
| AZURE-AKS-05 | Kubernetes RBAC with Azure AD Integration | Integrate the AKS cluster with Azure Active Directory. Use Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) for Kubernetes Authorization to manage access rather than local K8s accounts or certificates. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 2.4; NIST Rev 5 AC-2 |
| AZURE-AKS-06 | Container Insights with Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) | Enable Container Insights on the cluster. Ensure the configuration uses the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) for log collection. Do not use the legacy Log Analytics agent (MMA/OMS). | Data Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 5.1; NIST Rev 5 AU-12 |
| AZURE-AKS-07 | VNet Flow Logs Configuration | Enable VNet Flow Logs for the subnets hosting the AKS node pools to monitor network traffic metadata. Do not rely on NSG Flow Logs; use VNet Flow Logs for enhanced visibility and analysis. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 5.2; NIST Rev 5 AU-3 |
| AZURE-AKS-08 | Microsoft Defender for Containers | Enable Microsoft Defender for Containers on the subscription and target AKS cluster. This provides run-time threat detection and vulnerability scanning for container images in ACR. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 2.6; NIST Rev 5 SI-4 |
| AZURE-AKS-09 | Private AKS Cluster Deployment | Deploy the AKS cluster as a Private Cluster to ensure the API server endpoint has an internal IP address within the VNet and is not exposed to the public internet. | Control Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 2.2; NIST Rev 5 SC-7(3) |
| AZURE-AKS-10 | Network Policy Enforcement | Enable network policies (using Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico) to secure traffic between pods. Implement a default deny-all ingress/egress policy and allow only required communication. | Data Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 6.5; NIST Rev 5 SC-7 |
| AZURE-AKS-11 | Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver | Do not store secrets in etcd or environment variables. Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver to mount secrets, keys, and certificates into pods via a volume. | Data Plane | CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmark v3.0 8.4; NIST Rev 5 SC-12 |
