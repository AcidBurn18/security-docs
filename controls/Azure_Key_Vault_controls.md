# Security Controls: Azure Key Vault

| ID | Name | Description | Plane | Mapping |
|----|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| AZ-KV-01 | Organizational Naming Standards | Ensure the Azure Key Vault name follows strict organizational naming conventions (e.g., kv-app-env-region) to distinguish resources and prevent global namespace collisions. | Control Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8 |
| AZ-KV-02 | Resource Tagging Strategy | Apply mandatory tags (CostCenter, DataClassification, Owner, Environment) to the Key Vault resource to support cost allocation, automation, and security governance. | Control Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8 |
| AZ-KV-03 | Security Monitoring and Alerting | Enable Diagnostic Settings to stream 'AuditEvent' and 'AzurePolicyEvaluationDetails' logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. Integrate with Microsoft Defender for Key Vault to detect unusual access patterns. Ensure log retention aligns with compliance requirements. | Control Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 5.1.4; NIST Rev 5 AU-2 |
| AZ-KV-04 | Enable Soft Delete and Purge Protection | Ensure Soft Delete is enabled with a retention period of at least 7 days (default 90) and Purge Protection is enabled to prevent accidental or malicious permanent data loss before the retention period expires. | Control Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 8.4; NIST Rev 5 CP-9 |
| AZ-KV-05 | Azure RBAC Authorization Model | Configure the Key Vault access configuration to use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) instead of legacy Vault Access Policies to enable fine-grained permission management at the individual key, secret, or certificate level. | Control Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 8.5; NIST Rev 5 AC-3 |
| AZ-KV-06 | Managed Identity Integration | Authenticate applications accessing the Key Vault using System-Assigned or User-Assigned Managed Identities. Do not use Service Principals with client secrets or connection strings stored in code. | Data Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 8.5; NIST Rev 5 IA-2 |
| AZ-KV-07 | Key and Secret Expiration Enforcement | Ensure all keys, secrets, and certificates have a defined expiration date set. Leverage Azure Policy to audit or deny the creation of items without expiration dates to enforce lifecycle management. | Data Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 8.2; NIST Rev 5 SC-12(3) |
| AZ-KV-08 | Private Endpoint and Firewall Configuration | Disable public internet access to the Key Vault. Use Azure Private Link (Private Endpoints) for connectivity from Virtual Networks. Set the firewall default action to 'Deny'. | Data Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 6.6; NIST Rev 5 AC-4 |
| AZ-KV-09 | Automated Key Rotation | Configure automated key rotation policies for Customer Managed Keys (CMK). Ensure rotation intervals adhere to organizational crypto standards (e.g., 90 days). | Data Plane | CIS Azure v3.0 8.1; NIST Rev 5 SC-12 |
