# Security Controls: Google Compute Engine

| ID | Name | Description | Plane | Mapping |
|----|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| GCP-GCE-01 | Organizational Naming Standards | Establish a strict naming convention for Google Compute Engine instances that includes environment, region, workload type, and sequence to facilitate auditing and policy enforcement via Organization Policy Service. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8(1) |
| GCP-GCE-02 | Resource Tagging Strategy | Implement mandatory labels (tags) for Cost Center, Data Classification, and Owner. Use these labels to drive conditional IAM policies and firewall rules within the VPC. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 CM-8(2) |
| GCP-GCE-03 | Security Monitoring and Alerting | Deploy the Google Cloud Ops Agent (formerly Stackdriver) to instances to collect OS-level logs and metrics. Configure Cloud Logging sinks to export logs to a centralized storage bucket or Pub/Sub for analysis in Security Command Center (SCC) or SIEM. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 2.1; NIST Rev 5 AU-12 |
| GCP-GCE-04 | Enable OS Login | Configure the metadata key 'enable-oslogin' to TRUE. This ties SSH access to IAM permissions rather than managing SSH keys directly on the instance, enabling MFA and centralized lifecycle management. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.1; NIST Rev 5 AC-2(1) |
| GCP-GCE-05 | Block Project-wide SSH Keys | Ensure 'Block Project-wide SSH keys' is enabled for VM instances to prevent users from using generic project-level keys to access sensitive workloads, enforcing granular per-instance or OS Login access. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.2; NIST Rev 5 AC-3 |
| GCP-GCE-06 | Enable Shielded VM | Enable Shielded VM features including Secure Boot, vTPM (Virtual Trusted Platform Module), and Integrity Monitoring to protect against boot-level and kernel-level rootkits. | Data Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.4; NIST Rev 5 SI-7(1) |
| GCP-GCE-07 | Restrict Default Service Account Privileges | Configure instances to use User-Managed Service Accounts with the principle of least privilege rather than the Compute Engine default service account. Ensure scopes are not set to 'Allow full access to all Cloud APIs'. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.5; NIST Rev 5 AC-6 |
| GCP-GCE-08 | Disable IP Forwarding | Ensure IP Forwarding is disabled on the network interface unless the instance is specifically designed as a network appliance (e.g., NAT gateway, VPN concentrator). | Data Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.7; NIST Rev 5 SC-7 |
| GCP-GCE-09 | Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) | Utilize Cloud KMS Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for Persistent Disks rather than Google-managed keys to maintain cryptographic control and allow for immediate key revocation. | Data Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 1.1; NIST Rev 5 SC-28(1) |
| GCP-GCE-10 | Disable Serial Port Connections | Ensure the serial console port is disabled to prevent non-network administrative access to the instance console, which bypasses standard network controls. | Control Plane | CIS GCP v3.0 4.8; NIST Rev 5 AC-17 |
